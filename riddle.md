There are two identical doors.
One door leads to doom, the other to salvation.
In front of the doors are two identical guards.
One guard only tells lies, the other only tells the truth.
You may only ask either of the guards one question.
You don't know which guard is which.
What question you can ask a guard that will inform you how to pick the correct door?
